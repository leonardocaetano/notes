# this is a start of a new book on python and programming in general. 

# ====== 01 - starting with python
# human language is too confusing for a computer to understand, although LLMs are changing that. 
# python has this IDLE, but we can ignore it and just use this

# ====== 02 - python and programming
# well... programming has a lot to do with organizing. when dealing with a client who has a solution to a problem, 
# you need first to really understand what the client wants. and only than you can type precise instructions to a computer
# the point being: have a damn spec. 
# there's also the point that programmers who can communicate well gets more opportunities and money and etc. true to some extend

# and yes, you can process data with python...

# yes. believe or not. python has functions.

# this outputs the ascii (utf-8) value of the expression in decimal
# this ord function expects a single char as the input
print(ord('w'))
print(ord('รง'))

# chr is the opposite of ord
print(chr(119))
print(chr(231))

# we do also have bin
print(bin(1))
print(bin(255))
print(bin(256))
