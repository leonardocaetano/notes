# REMEMBER TO DONWLOAD THE COURSE FILES (and put it on desktop k)

# so... python has variables... and also f-strings

# in python a variable is a not a box, but a _label_ (a pointer? a reference?)

first_name = 'ada'

#the  .rstrip() removes the extra whitespace from left and right sides

with_prefix = "abc.python"
print(with_prefix.removeprefix('abc.'))

# so... we can see that python has various methods to dealing with strings, stuff like .title(),
# .captilize(), etc... they don't alter the original strings

# the difference between single and double quotes

# single_string = 'This is a 'single' quote string.'
double_string = "This is a 'double' quote string."

# print(single_string)
print(double_string)

# you can use the double quotes when the single quote is likely to be used in a string

# ---- NUMBERS ----

print(2 + 3 * 4) # prints 14
print((2+3) * 4) # prints 20

# python can also deal with floats

print(2 ** 16) # same as 2^16

print(65_536) # this makes numbers more readable

ass1, ass2, ass3 = 321, 23.4, "bruh" #this is how you do multiple assignments

print(ass2)
print(ass3)

THIS_IS_A_CONSTANT = "Get REAL SKILLZ" #captilize all letters to make it a constant
ass3 = "not_bruh" # since this is not a constant, you can re-assign it

# python has this goofy "zen of python" philosofy, that says things like "avoid complexity" which is good, but
# also says stuff like "beautiful is better then ugly" ???????
# there's also "if two python programmers are asked to solve the same problem, the result should be the same"
# meaning "there should be one -- and preferably --- only one obvious way to do it."

# --- LISTS --- (aka arrays)

steely_dan = ['aja', 'gaucho', 'pretzel_logic'] # the [] is what indicates a list

print(steely_dan[0]) # this is how you access a list, and yes, we start at [0]

# print(steely_dan.title()) # but you can't do this

print(steely_dan[-1]) # do have this syntax to access the last element, ofc it prints pretzel_logic

# to append new items to a list, you can just reassign it, repeating all the old elements and adding the new ones

# but you can also append elemets

steely_dan.append('katy_lied') # this will be [3]
steely_dan.append("can't_buy_a_thrill") # and [4]

print(steely_dan) # append doesnt go back in time to apply changes, so you have to reprint if you want to see all

# and we can also pop them

steely_dan.pop()

print(steely_dan) # popping only removes the last item

# if you want to remove a specifc item do

steely_dan.remove('gaucho')

# you can also do this

item_to_remove = 'aja'

steely_dan.remove(item_to_remove) 

print(steely_dan)

# @NOTE: the remove() method only remove the first appearence of a element, you need to use a loop to make sure all elements that are the same is remove

# for last, you can manually change a specific element of the list

steely_dan[0] = 'the_nightfly'

# you can also use the insert and delete with lists, you can also sort them!!!

steely_dan.sort()
print(steely_dan)
steely_dan.sort(reverse=True)
print(steely_dan)

# vim @NOTE: when in visual mode, the cursor position is also selected
# the pasting happens after the cursor, and below!!!

# back to lists: yeah, there's a lot of methods you can apply to it... reverse, sort, len, sorted...
# the difference between sort and sorted is that sorted criates a new list, while sort affects the original

# ---- WORKING WITH LISTS ----

# i can only guess that append gets by context that it is appended to a whole list
# well, append probably doesnt work with a single element anyways
# so, it also knows that it is inside a loop. so that's why the interface for incrementing the list 
# doesnt need to exist here

# python also has a few built in numeric functions that shows statistics with lists
# the min, max, sum and others

    # note that we defined default values, but they are optional, the age argument is made
    # optional with the none
    if age:

# but you also can do a name-value pair with keyword arguments
# you specify this on a function call

print(animal_and_owner(animal='parrot', owner='george'))
print(animal_and_owner(owner='ringo', age='30')) # and if the function was defined with default values, we can ommit the arguments in a funciton call

# ofc, you can pass and rerturn lists and dictionaries
# we can also modify them inside a function

# you can prevent a function to modify a list by appending [:] in the end
# function_name(list_name[:])
# you can also have a arbitraty number of arguments using the * operator, also called *args

def albums(*record):
    print(record)

albums('dsotm', 'abbey_road', 'mbdtf')

# there's also **, also called **kargs but we need to learn they later
# we can also store your functions in modules (that in fact are just other files), that you include using import
# you can just do module_name.function_name(), were module_name is just the file_name.py 
# you can also do
# from module_name import function_name
# from module_name import *
# import module_name 
# import module_name as mn
# from module_name import function_name as alias
# and then you call alias()

# CHAPTER 9: CLASSES

# the book tries to evangelise OOP here, 
# so, in OOP you create classes "that represents real-world _things_" and objects based on these classes 
# when you create a class you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects will have

# when you create a object over a class, this is called _instantiation_
# and you work with instances of a class

class dog: # THE FUNCTION THAT IS PART OF A CLASS IS CALLED A METHOD
    # the __init()__ method is a special one that runs automatically everytime we __CREATE__ a object (or a new instance) based on a class
    # the self parameter is also special and required, it needs to be the first one
    # every variable prefixed with self will be accessible for every method in the class
    def __init__(self, name, age): 
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        print("This is being exec now.")

        print(f"{self.name} has {self.age} and now is sitting.")
    def roll_over(self):
        print(f"{self.name} has {self.age} and now is rolling over.")
my_dog = dog("Jo√£o", 10)

my_dog.sit()
my_dog.roll_over()

# you can also do:

print(f"my_dog name is {my_dog.name} and his age is {my_dog.age}.")

my_other_dog = dog("Pedro", 15)

# and that are the basics of it. but there's more.

# INHERITANCE

# we always can start a new class from scratch, but we are also able to inherit a child class that provides specialized functionality

class electric_dog(dog):
    def __init__(self, name, age, battery):
        self.battery = battery
        super().__init__(name, age) 
    def battery_information(self):
        print(f"{self.name} has {self.age} and his battery points is {self.battery}.")

        print(f"{self.name} has {self.age} and now is rolling over even more!")

my_e_dog = electric_dog("Joaquim", 20, 65)

my_e_dog.sit()
my_e_dog.roll_over()
my_e_dog.battery_information()

# super() thing on the __init__ method is a special function that allows you to call a method from a parent class. the name super comes from calling a
# convention of calling a parent class a superclass and a child subclass 
# in this case we are calling the __init__ method, but we could call any others my_e_dog = electric_dog("Joaquim", 20, 50)
# we overide a method from a parent class just by redefining it

# you can also import a class from other file using
# from dog import electric_dog 
# where dog is a dog.py file, which are also called a MODULEA
# ofc we can also just do
# from dog import *
# annnnnd offfc you can import a module into a module, but that doesnt metter rn

# THE PYTHON STD LIB

# yes, there's one

# there are funtionality that is available in every python installation
# and you can have more by using pip

from random import randint
from random import choice
